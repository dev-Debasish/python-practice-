#! Coin Flip Streaks
For this exercise, we’ll try doing an experiment. If you flip a coin 100 times and write down an H for each heads and a T for each tails, you’ll create a list that looks like T T T T H H H H T T. If you ask a human to make up 100 random coin flips, you’ll probably end up with alternating heads-tails results like H T H T H H T H T T—which looks random (to humans), but isn’t mathematically random. A human will almost never write down a streak of six heads or six tails in a row, even though it is highly likely to happen in truly random coin flips. Humans are predictably bad at being random.
Write a program to find out how often a streak of six heads or a streak of six tails comes up in a randomly generated list of 100 heads and tails. Your program should break up the experiment into two parts: the first part generates a list of 100 randomly selected 'H' and 'T' values, and the second part checks if there is a streak in it. Put all of this code in a loop that repeats the experiment 10,000 times so that you can find out what percentage of the coin flips contains a streak of six heads or six tails in a row. As a hint, the function call random.randint(0, 1) will return a 0 value 50 percent of the time and a 1 value the other 50 percent of the time.

You can start with the following template:
#!
import random
number_of_streaks = 0
for experiment_number in range(10000):  # Run 100,000 experiments total.
    # Code that creates a list of 100 'heads' or 'tails' values

    # Code that checks if there is a streak of 6 heads or tails in a row
    
print('Chance of streak: %s%%' % (number_of_streaks / 100))
#!
Of course, this is only an estimate, but 10,000 is a decent sample size. Some knowledge of mathematics could give you the exact answer and save you the trouble of writing a program, but programmers are notoriously bad at math.
To create a list, use a for loop that appends a randomly selected 'H' or 'T' to a list 100 times. To determine if there is a streak of six heads or six tails, create a slice like some_list[i:i + 6] (which contains the six items starting at index i) and then compare it to the list values ['H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H'] and ['T', 'T', 'T', 'T', 'T', 'T'].

TODO:
Because the goal is to count:
“How many of the 10,000 experiments contain at least one streak of 6?”
